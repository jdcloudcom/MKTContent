<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong>Provide reliable and efficient JDMigration services</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The cloud computing market size is expanding nowadays. Some users may migrate all of or part of the system from one to another cloud computing environment in order to enhance the business performance, security and reduce costs or to improve the system reliability by using multi-cloud architecture. Demands on cloud migration is increasing and facing challenges.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><br/></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">JD Cloud supports immigration of user business system in an all-round way and provides reference guidance for JDMigration of users by building a complete cloud migration technical framework and design, effective JDMigration model and component migration policy. The White Paper provides both the effective JDMigration system and security guarantee measures as well as migration methods and main steps for migration of computing environment, data storage, network environment, middleware system, management environment and security product, offering powerful supports for smooth migration from user business system to JD Cloud, cost decreasing and benefit increasing of users and fast growth of businesses.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong>Elastic and Flexible Deployment of Modularized Migration Technology</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The JDMigration architecture of cloud computing is mainly divided into four parts, i.e., analysis, design, implementation and verification as well as optimization. The White Paper indicates that, in order to implement the above migration framework, JD Cloud has designed a JDMigration model as shown in below figure based on system split and reorganization.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The complex system migration model is divided into four parts, i.e. system split, module migration, system combination as well as evaluation and verification, and the system status during this process is divided into original status, submodule migration status, system integration status and fulfilled status. At the original status of the system, the system is spilt into several independent components according to the characteristics of each module of the system. With respect to each independent component spilt, the submodule will implement migration to form the submodule migration status. After all submodules are migrated and verified, the entire system shall be combined to form the system integration status. Fully verify the integrated system. In case of failing to pass the verification, roll back the process and re-assess the migration method; in case of passing the verification, the system enters the fulfilled status of migration and the business volumes of users can be switched to the new system.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><br/></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For independent components spilt by the complex system, there are four main migration policies, namely rehosting, repurchase, platform replacement and rebuild.</p>
