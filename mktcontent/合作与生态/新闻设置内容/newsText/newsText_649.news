Chen Huiling indicated that digital economy, as a new form of social and economic development following agricultural economy and industrial economy, has become the mainstream model of innovative development of the world economy. The digital transformation of Chinese enterprises is still in the exploratory stage. Compared with the developed countries in Europe and the United States, there is still a big gap for the development of digital transformation in China. When pushing forward the digital transformation, enterprises should not only define, perform and implement the digital transformation strategy from the perspectives of team, technology and process, but also join hands with partners to give full play to their advantages and jointly explore new opportunities in the era of digital economy.</p>
