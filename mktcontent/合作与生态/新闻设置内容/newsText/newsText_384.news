<p style="text-indent: 2em;">After connecting the cellphone and the telescope, the user can directly view the vast sky via the cellphone, using the astronomical telescope as the cellphone "Sky APP" accessible to everyone. It is no wonder that the authority of CES 2019 regarded the telescope as the candidate of "Tech For A Better World". The consumer can access the technical and innovative product integrated with fashion, observation, social intercourse and entertainment in JD Mall in the near future, making his/her dream of astronomy come true.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Research and development of the product have been completed with technical benefits of the JD Cloud platform. Upon mass production, mass data produced by the user and the expended applications will be migrated to the JD Cloud platform as well. The application of advanced technologies as Cloud Computing and others give more development space to the telescope, the traditional icy device." Liu Zihao, Vice President of JD Group and Head of JD Cloud Ecology Business was very excited for the awards won by the scientific and technical projects submitted to CES by JD for the first time. The astronomical telescope relies on conventional technical standards, such as optical design and star finding capacity. However, the "Internet +" Telescope, based on Cloud Computing and other technologies, focuses more on the client experiences, such as image acquisition and social sharing functions, turning an astronomical telescope to a "Sky APP".</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">According to its introduction, the entry-level Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope (the Maksutov telescope for short) adopts a thick and half-moon correcting lens of high curvature, achieving better observation performance and clearer details. With the eye lens able to be connected to a smartphone and the cool appearance, it overturns the tedious and heavy image of a common telescope in the public mind and rebuilds an experience type scientific and technical product integrating functions of fashion, observation, social intercourse and entertainment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As for the design intent for such an innovative product, relevant person in charge of Zhongke Xingxuan (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., the partner of JD Cloud, represented that the public have little recognition and penetration to the astronomy and the aerospace, in addition to the short-term hot topics such as launch of rocket and satellite. For a long time, the public get to know the national astronomy and aerospace business mostly via channels as the planetarium, the science and technology museum and other experimental places. They expect to get close to and appreciate secrets of the astronomy, but lack of approaches and entry points. This product is a scientific telescope, which combines the latest Internet technology, makes the minor scientific and technical product of the astronomical telescope popularize rapidly, further pushes scientific popularization of the astronomy and improves the consumer’s quality of life.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><br/></p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As introduced by the person in charge, "By cloud computing and shooting with a cellphone, the users can conveniently share and spread information, enhancing social attributes of the product and making more and more ordinary persons be interested in and be fond of the astronomy."</p>
