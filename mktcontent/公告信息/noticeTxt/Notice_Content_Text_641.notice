<p>In order to provide JCS for MongoDB Service in a better way, JD Cloud will upgrade the JCS for MongoDB System from 21:00 on March 28, 2019 to 1:00 on March 29, 2019. During such period, the Console access and OpenAPI services will be suspended, and the system upgrade will not affect the normal running of existing MongoDB instances. After the upgrade, the Console and OpenAPI will be resumed normal.</p>
<p>If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
