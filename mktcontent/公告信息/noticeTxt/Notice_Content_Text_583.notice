During such period, the console access to Native Container Instance, Pod and Secrets and the use of OpenAPI in cn-east-2 region will be suspended, but this suspension will not influence other regions. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
