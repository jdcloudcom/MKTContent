Affected by the epidemic, the scheduled plan of resuming invoice mailing business from February 10 will still be suspended and tentatively resumed from February 17 so as to avoid risks of virus transmission arising from logistics, distribution and other steps. If there is any change, an announcement or notice will be issued separately, and we apologize for the inconvenience brought to you. If you need any critical help, please contact us by ticket or telephone. 400-615-1212. Thank you for your understanding and support.
