<p>JD Cloud Computing Co., Ltd. will issue and send invoices in succession since today. To avoid invoice loss, please make sure that there is a receiver at the receiving address and open a manual ticket (https://ticket.jdcloud.com/applyorder/form?cateId=7&amp;questionId=31) for invoice reception. If we do not receive your ticket, it is deemed by us that there is no receiver at the receiving address. In such case, we will not send the invoice to you. Thank you for your understanding. Thank You</p>
