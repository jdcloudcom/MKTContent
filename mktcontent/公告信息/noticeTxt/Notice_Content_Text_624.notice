<p><span style="font-family:&#39;微软雅黑&#39;,sans-serif;color:black">In order to better meet the requirements of high-performance, high-reliability and low-latency Customer Identity and Access Management, JD Cloud plans to conduct the launch of IAM backend service optimization on March 8, 2019 from 00:00:00 to 02:30:00. By then:</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif;">The creation, editing, deletion and authorization functions of the sub-users, groups, roles, policies, password policies of IAM Console and Open API will be suspended.</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif; text-indent: 14px;">This launch does not affect your access to the product line as a sub-user and role. The Console will be resumed upon completion of launching. If you have relevant questions during the launching, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (phone number: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</span>
