<p style="text-indent: 56px"><span style="font-family:&#39;微软雅黑&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">In order to provide more stable and high-quality service, JD Cloud will upgrade the underlayer service for live video products from 04:00 to 06:00 on April 28, 2019. The upgrade process is about 2-3 minutes, and the new live streaming in the process will not be pushed; the live streaming that has been pushed will not be affected. Please know that we will try our best to shorten the upgrade time and ensure business continuity.</span>
