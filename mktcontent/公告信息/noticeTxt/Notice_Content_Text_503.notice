<p>In order to provide you with more stable Message Queue Service, we will upgrade the architecture and optimize the functions during the open beta test of Message Queue from October 26, 2018, 15:00 (Beijing time) to October 26, 2018, 23:59 (Beijing time). In this period, the console management, receiving and sending messages by SDK and HTTP of Message Queue at [public network (North China)] and [cn-north-1] regions will be influenced. Users are required to back up relevant data in advance to guarantee the completeness of user data. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time by ticket and phone (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
