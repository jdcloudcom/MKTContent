<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear user(s), in order to provide more stable and high-performance service, it is planned to upgrade the Message Queue of JD Cloud from 22:00:00, March 21, 2019 to 06:00:00, March 22, 2019. During this period,</p>
<p>Operation in the Console and Open API in regions [Public Network (North China)] and [cn-north-1] via the Message Queue will be suspended, while such service in other regions will not be affected.</p>
<p>None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent businesses running in all of your regions. The Console will resume normal use after the upgrades. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (phone number: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
