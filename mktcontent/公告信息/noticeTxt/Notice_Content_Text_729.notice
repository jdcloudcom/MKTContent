<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif; color: black; font-size: 14px;">In order to provide you with more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade JCS for Kubernetes service from 21:00:00 to 23:00:00 on July 23, 2019. During such period, access to JCS for Kubernetes and the Console of working node groups and use of OpenAPI in cn-north-1 will be suspended, but other regions will not be affected. None of the above upgrade will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The Console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrade.</span>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif; color: black; font-size: 14px;">For any questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</span>
