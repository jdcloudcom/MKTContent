<p>In order to provide more stable services, JD Cloud will upgrade the Virtual Machines and Native Container Services from 22:00:00 on May 21 to 00:59:59 on May 22, 2019. During such period, the Console access to Virtual Machines and Native Container and the use of OpenAPI in cn-north-1 region will be paused, but this pause will not influence other regions.</p>
<p>None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The Console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
