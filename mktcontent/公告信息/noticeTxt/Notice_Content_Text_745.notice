<p>In order to optimize the licensing system process, JD Cloud plans to carry out maintenance and update from 19:00 to 23:00 on August 27, 2019.</p>
<p>At that time, the ICP License Service will suspend the new licensing function and the licensing review function. All licensing process statuses will not be viewed at the front desk, and the services will resume normal use after system update.</p>
<p>If you have relevant questions during the launching, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (phone number: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
