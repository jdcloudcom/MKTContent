<p>Dear user(s), in order to provide you with more stable services, JD Cloud will upgrade the Elastic Compute and Network Service from 22:00:00 to 23:59:59 on December 6, 2018. During such period, the console access to Elastic Compute and Network Service and the use of OpenAPI in cn-east-2 will be suspended, but this suspension will not influence other regions. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
