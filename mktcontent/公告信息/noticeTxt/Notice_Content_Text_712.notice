<p>In order to provide you with more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade JCS for Kubernetes services from 21:00:00 on July 1, 2019 to 23:00:00 on July 1. During such period, the access to JCS for Kubernetes and the Console of working node groups and use of OpenAPI in the region cn-south-1 will be suspended, but will not be affected in other regions. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The Console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
