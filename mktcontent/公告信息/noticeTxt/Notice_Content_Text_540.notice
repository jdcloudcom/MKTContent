<p>Dear user(s), in order to provide more quality service, JD Cloud will upgrade RDS SQL Server Service from 21:00:00 to 23:59:59 on November 28, 2018. During such period, the Console access to all RDS regions and the use of OpenAPI will be paused. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>

<p>If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
