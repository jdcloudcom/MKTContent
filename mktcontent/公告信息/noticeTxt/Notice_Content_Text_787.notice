<p style="margin-left:28px;text-indent:28px"><span style="font-family: 微软雅黑, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); font-size: 12px;">JD Cloud plans to upgrade the underlayer service of Cloud Physical Server (CPS) in [cn-north-1 Availability Zone B] from 22:00 on November 19, 2019 to 02:00 on November 20, 2019. By that time, services regarding Cloud Physical Server (CPS) Console and OpenAPI in [All Regions] will be paused. <br/> Influences are as follows: <br/> Cloud Physical Server (CPS) Console will display the page under maintenance and no operation can be made. All OpenAPI services operated by instances will be paused, with operations such as search in other regions unaffected. <br/> This functional upgrade will not affect the normal running of your existing Cloud Physical Server. After completion of release, relevant functions of the Console and corresponding APIs of OpenAPI will be resumed for normal use. <br/>If you have relevant questions during the launch, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (phone number: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</span>
