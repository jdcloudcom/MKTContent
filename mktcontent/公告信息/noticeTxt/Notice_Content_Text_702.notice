<p>In order to provide you with better services, JD Cloud will upgrade the Distributed Relational Database Service (DRDS) from 19:00 on June 24, 2019 to 5:00 on June 25, 2019.</p>
<p>By then, access to the DRDS Console will be suspended, and none of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The Console will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you have any questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 400-615-1212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
