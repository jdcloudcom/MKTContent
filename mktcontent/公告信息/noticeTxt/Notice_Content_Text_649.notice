<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to provide more stable and high-performance services, JD Cloud Message Queue is planned to upgrade and optimize services from 21:00:00, April 10, 2019 to 06:00:00, April 11, 2019. During this period, Operation in the Console and Open API in regions [Public Network (North China)] and [cn-north-1] via the Message Queue will be suspended, while such services in other regions will not be affected. None of the above upgrades will affect your normal running of inherent businesses in all of your regions. The Console will resume normal use after the upgrades. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (phone number: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
