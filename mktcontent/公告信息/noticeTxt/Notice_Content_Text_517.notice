<p>Dear user(s), in order to provide you with more stable Load Balancer Service, JD Cloud will upgrade the Load Balancer from November 13, 2018, 21:00:00 to November 14, 00:59:59. During this period, the Load Balancer console access and the OpenAPI service will be temporarily interrupted in all regions (cn-north-1, cn-south-1, cn-east-1 and cn-east-2), but this temporary interruption will neither influence other regions nor have impact on your inherent business in all regions. During the upgrade process, there are no data displayed in the Load Balancer monitoring chart of Monitoring, but the query to historic monitoring data will not be influenced. The console will be resumed upon completion of upgrade. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
