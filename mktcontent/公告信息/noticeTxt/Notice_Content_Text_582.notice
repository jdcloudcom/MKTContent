<p>Dear user(s), in order to provide more stable services, JD Cloud will upgrade the Elastic Compute and Network Service from 23:00:00 on December 26, 2018 to 02:59:59 on December 27, 2018. During such period, the console access to Elastic Compute and Network Service and the use of OpenAPI in cn-north-1 region will be suspended, but this suspension will not influence other regions. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
