		<span style="font-size: 12px;">In order to deliver more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade RDS services from &nbsp;21:00 on April 17, 2019&nbsp; to &nbsp;5:00 on April 18, 2019&nbsp;. During this period, the Console access and OpenAPI calling to RDS in all regions will be temporarily suspended. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</span>
