<p>Dear user, in order to provide you with more stable Load Balancer service, JD Cloud will transfer the Load Balancer control nodes to JCS from October 24, 2018, 21:00:00 to October 25, 2018, 00:59:59. During this period, the Load Balancer console access and OpenAPI service in cn-north-1 region will be temporarily interrupted, but this temporary interruption will neither influence other regions nor have impact on your inherent businesses in all regions. The console will be resumed upon completion of migration. If you have relevant questions during the migration, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
