<p>In order to provide you with more stable IAAS cloud product service, JD Cloud will upgrade the IAAS product online database from October 23, 2018, 21:00:00 to October 23, 22:59:59. During this period, the Virtual Machine, Network, and Cloud Disk Service, each product console access and OpenAPI service in cn-east-1 region will be temporarily interrupted, but this temporary interception will neither influence other regions nor have impact on your inherent businesses in all regions. The console will be resumed upon completion of switchover. If you have relevant questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
