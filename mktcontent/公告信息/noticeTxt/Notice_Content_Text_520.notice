<span style="font-family:&#39;微软雅黑&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">In order to provide better JCS for MongoDB service, JD Cloud will upgrade the JCS for MongoDB system from 21:00 on November 14, 2018 to 1:00 on November 15, 2018, during which the cn-east-2 region's console access and OpenAPI service will be paused, and the normal running of MongoDB instances won’t be affected, and upon completion of upgrading, the console and OpenAPI will be resumed. If you have relevant questions during the upgrading, please contact JD Cloud customer service personnel at any time (Tel: 4006151212). Thanks for your support to JD Cloud. </span>
