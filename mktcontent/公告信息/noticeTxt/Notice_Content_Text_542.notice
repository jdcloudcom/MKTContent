<p>Dear users, in order to provide you with more stable service, JD Cloud will upgrade RDS from 21:00 on November 29, 2018 to 1:00 on November 30, 2018. During this period, the console access service and OpenAPI calling in [cn-east-2] will be temporarily paused, with other regions not influenced. None of the above upgrades will affect your inherent business running in all of your regions. The console and OpenAPI will resume normal use after the upgrades.</p>
<p>If you have any questions during the upgrade, please contact JD Cloud Customer Service at any time (Tel: 400-615-1212). Thank you for your support to JD Cloud.</p>
