<p>JD Cloud plans to switch from the General VAT Invoice to Electronic Invoice from April 8, 2019. The electronic plain invoice is a valid receipt and payment certificate recognized by the taxation authorities. Its legal effect, basic use and usage rules are the same as paper plain invoice, which can be used for reimbursement and after-sales rights protection. If you have any problems, please contact us by ticket or phone (400-615-1212). Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>
