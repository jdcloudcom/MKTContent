		"project_overview":"Kujiale's rendering business has been increasing exponentially through the years, with underlayer distributed rendering cluster deployed in multiple IDC data centers. Under a computing scenario where data density and complexity are extremely high, the distributed cluster owns a maximum processing speed reaching 2wQPM, with a daily rendering volume up to 5 million pieces and daily rendering pixels greater than 15 trillion at 2020Q1. Based on high-performance physical server, this cluster has a high purchase cost and difficulties in operation and maintenance and its biggest bottleneck is that its capacity cannot be expanded and shrunk.\nJD Cloud & AI Distributed Rendering Cluster is a cross-cloud and multi-active cluster that provides its own IDC rendering with expansion computing resources.",

As traditional rendering platforms based on physical server require support from IDC, network, electricity and other facilities, it takes huge purchase costs and a long procurement cycle. By cooperating with JD Cloud & AI, Kujiale's rendering makes a leap from cluster deployment to Hybrid Cloud deployment, saving Kujiale a great deal of funds, which can be put into R&D to create higher additional value. </br>\nMeanwhile, it simplified the operation and maintenance. Without operation and maintenance of traditional data centers, lots of labor and materials are saved; the 24-hour uninterrupted operation of servers is guaranteed by professional JD Cloud & AI, greatly reducing the pressure borne by the IT basic operation and maintenance team; accordingly, Kujiale can have the energy to focus on its own business making, enhancing its enterprise competitiveness. </br>\nIn addition, the flexible billing methods help customers decrease the financial pressure. As the resources of cloud computing are paid on demand, Kujiale will dynamically adjust the resources of cloud computing according to the traffic size, and under the principles of a higher fee for more use and a lower fee for less use, the input-output ratio is perfectly achieved based on the different amounts of business.",
