For example: JD Cloud provides Beichun Group with Intelligent solutions for farm according its specific business system architecture:</br>

1) IoT Production and Monitoring Platform: Functions such as real-time data monitoring and monitoring data transmission are included in this module through which data of diseases and pests status, soil moisture status and seedling status can be collected, transmitted, managed and maintained in a classified and time-shared manner and different kinds of data can be maintained in a modularized manner. This platform can be operated separately and can also be managed comprehensively;</br>

2) Intelligent Farm Management Platform: Through this platform, overall management of the farm’s basic information, farming work, farming materials, processing and tracing can be realized and the standardization and precision management of agriculture can be improved;</br>

3) Anti-counterfeiting and Tracing System for Blockchain of Agricultural Products: This platform integrates the IoT collecting technology and automatic sensing technology through which the unknown risks arising from manual intervention during data uploading can be reduced, the automatic collection of real data during the process of crop growth, production, processing, packaging, detection and logistics can be realized and the food quality can be managed and controlled from the source by automatic technological means. Based on blockchain technology, cooperation with consortium blockchain members will be made to jointly maintain the security and transparency of tracing information, and a technological confidence-building mechanism will be established to ensure the immutability and privacy protection of data so as to achieve anti-forgery and whole-process tracing in a real sense;</br>

4) Central Command Center Through the “one map” for the park on the large screen, the data of the park’s environment, soil and diseases and pests can be displayed and analyzed in a centralized manner. In this way, the links such as production, processing and logistics can be comprehensively controlled and intelligently managed, besides, the intelligent warning management of the environment can be realized. As a result, the decision-making efficiency and quality of production and management can be improved.
