For example: JD Cloud offers Beichun Group intelligent farm solutions with its business architecture:</br>

1) IoT Production and Monitoring Platform: it includes real-time data and data transmission monitoring, which collects, transmits, manages and maintains data of diseases and pests status, soil moisture status and seedling status  by category and time, and different data are maintained based on modules. It is operated separately or managed comprehensively;</br>

2) Intelligent Farm Management Platform: it enables overall management of a farm’s basic information, farming work, materials, processing and tracing and improves standardization and precision management of agriculture;</br>

3) Anti-counterfeiting and Tracing System for Blockchain of Farm Products: it integrates IoT collecting technology and automatic sensing technology, which reduces unknown risks arising from manual intervention during data uploading, with automatic collection of real data during  crop growth, production, processing, packaging, detection and logistics, and food quality is managed and controlled from source by automatic technologies. Based on blockchain, it cooperates with consortium blockchain members to maintain security and transparency of tracing information, and builds a technological confidence-building mechanism to ensure data immutability and privacy protection  and achieve anti-forgery and all-process tracing;</br>

4) Central Command Center: the park’s “one map” on large screen displays data of park’s environment, soil and diseases and pests and analyzes  intensively. Then,  production, processing and logistics are centrally controlled and intelligently managed, enabling intelligent warning management of environment, thus improving decision-making efficiency and quality of production and management.
