In the implementation phase, the complicated system is completely migrated based on the migration scheme and by migrating such system modules as computing, storage, networking, middleware as well as management and safety and then adopting system integration and optimization. In the verification phase, functions, performance, availability, reliability, safety, disaster tolerance, etc. are comprehensively verified, to obtain a complete verification and assessment report. In the optimization phase, the system is improved through performance adjustment and optimization, reinforcement of high availability, safety reinforcement, enhancement of service quality, etc.\",\"buttons\":{\"name\":\"\",\"link\":\"\",\"classTag\":\"\"}}]}",
