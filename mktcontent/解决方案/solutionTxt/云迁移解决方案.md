After the customer business system immigrates into JD Cloud, the system performance and security can be finally improved while the cost is reduced and the system reliability is enhanced. In the analysis phase of system migration, an analysis report is given upon effective migration model and migration policy by collecting detailed system information and user demands and after evaluating the system, security, resources, workload and costs. In the design phase, the cloud architecture and module migration policy are designed for the system architecture and main module of the user business system and the scheme designs for system, security, architecture, migration and test are produced. In the implementation and verification phase, based on the migration scheme, the system is completely migrated by immigration of such system modules as computing, storage, networking, middleware as well as management and security and then integrating the system. Functions, performance, availability, reliability, security, disaster recovery and other aspects are comprehensively verified to obtain a complete verification and assessment report. In the optimization phase, the system is improved through performance adjustment and optimization, reinforcement of high availability, safety reinforcement, enhancement of service quality, etc.\",\"buttons\":{\"name\":\"\",\"link\":\"\",\"classTag\":\"\"}}]}",
