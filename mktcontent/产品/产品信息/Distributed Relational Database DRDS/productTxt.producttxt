It can realize automatic sub-database and sub-table under massive data. With the advantages of high performance, distribution, flexible update, compatibility with MySQL, etc., it is applicable to online transactions of highly concurrent and large-scale data, historical data query, automatic data segmentation and other service scenarios. It has been used in large-scale within JD Group after multiple 618 and Double Eleven tests.\"}",
