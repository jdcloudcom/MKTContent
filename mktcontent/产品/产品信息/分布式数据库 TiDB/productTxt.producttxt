MySQL client management tools and all peripheral tools in the community are directly accessible, greatly reducing the costs of learning and use.\"},{\"proGood\":\"Fault Self-recovery and remote multi-active\",\"proName\":\"TiDB uses multiple copies for data storage and relies on the industry's most advanced Raft majority election algorithm to ensure 100% consistency and high availability of data. The copies can be distributed in different data centers across the regions. The original copy and duplicated copy can automatically switch in case of fault, without manual intervention, automatically ensuring the continuity of business and realizing real multi-activity in different places.\"},{\"proGood\":\"One-stop HTAP Solution\",\"proName\":\"As a typical OLTP row-storage database, TiDB has a powerful OLAP feature; a data can support OLTP & OLAP at the same time, without the traditional cumbersome ETL process, reducing the delay of data analysis and improving the real-time performance greatly.\"},{\"proGood\":\"Online DDL\",\"proName\":\"Update TiDB Schema on demand.
